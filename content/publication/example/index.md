abstract: Chatbots have become a worldwide phenomenon and find application in
  many different domains. However, their inability to reliably succeed in social
  contexts (e.g., on Social Network Sites, in therapy) significantly influences
  the user’s experience. To improve user experience developers and scholars have
  mostly concentrated on strategies that originate from the developers’ side.
  Less attention has been paid to the active involvement of the user and to
  potential customization options. Several psychological mechanisms suggest
  active customization to facilitate user engagement with the technology and
  potentially cushion conversational issues that still widely exist in today’s
  chatbot interactions. Reviewing existing literature and related empirical
  findings on this topic, we advocate the position that active
  User-Chatbot-Customization has great potential for user experience design and
  the improvement of user engagement in particular. Going forward, certain
  theoretical, empirical and methodological aspects discussed here must be
  overcome in order to further exploit this potential. Directions for future
  research are outlined.
