    description: I joined the Amsterdam School of Communication Research - ASCoR and the Center for research on Children, Adolescents and the Media - CcaM in September 2020 as a PhD student on the project "In Rosie We Trust? Virtual Assistants in Families". Virtual assistants, defined as applications that rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to understand voice command and carry out tasks for users, are becoming increasingly accessible around the globe and especially within the context of families with young children. To properly empower families to responsibly use this smart technology, respective scientific research is lacking. My dissertation focuses on filling this gap in the course of three studies (1. cross-sectional survey; 2. large-scale content analysis; 3. longitudinal data donation + intervention). Using a preregistered open-science framework, I hope to, together with my promotor (Jesica Piotrowski) and co-promotors (Theo Araujo, and Annemarie van Oosten), form implications for future work on technological trust formation that will stretch beyond the domain of virtual assistants.

    description: At Y.Digital I had the chance to gain first work experience in data science and software development. Working together with the great team at Y, parallel to finishing up my master thesis, allowed me to see aspects of my studies put into practice. It was super interesting to be involved in real business cycles of NLP use cases (i.e., text classification, semantic search) and to look over the shoulders of my talented colleagues. Under their guidance I gained first experience with version control (i.e., git and GitHub) as well as Python, and SQL. It was a great pleasure to be part of the Y family, watch a young start-up taking big steps forward, and to form valuable future connections. Since my heart laid in research afterall, I decided to end my time early at Y and accepted a PhD position on the use of virtual assistants in families. Nevertheless, I am grateful for my time at Y and am sure that paths will cross again some time.
