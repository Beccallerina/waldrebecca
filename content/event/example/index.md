abstract: >-
  Chatbots have become a worldwide phenomenon and find application

  in many different domains. However, their inability to reliably succeed in social

  contexts (e.g., on Social Network Sites, in therapy) significantly influences the

  user’s experience. To improve user experience developers and scholars have

  mostly concentrated on strategies that originate from the developers’ side. Less

  attention has been paid to the active involvement of the user and to potential customization options. Several psychological mechanisms suggest active customization to facilitate user engagement with the technology and potentially cushion

  conversational issues that still widely exist in today’s chatbot interactions. Reviewing existing literature and related empirical findings on this topic, we advocate the position that active User-Chatbot-Customization has great potential for

  user experience design and the improvement of user engagement in particular.

  Going forward, certain theoretical, empirical and methodological aspects discussed here must be overcome in order to further exploit this potential. Directions

  for future research are outlined.
